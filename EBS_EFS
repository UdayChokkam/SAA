EBS - elastic block store
mission critical - producton workloads , highly available and scalable
general purpose (gp2) ssd
gp3
io1
io2
hdd
st1- magnetic disks
sc1 - lowest cost option(cold hdd) 
iops - number of read and write operations per second
throughput - number of bits read or written per second
volume and snapshots(exist in s3 and incremental)
consistent snapshot  - stop instance and take snap
encryped snapshots - encrypted es
sharing snapshots - in the region 
EBS will always be in same AZ as EC2
resizing ebs volumes and change vlume types on the fly
encryptin  is end to end - transit and rest
snpshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted
create a snapshot of the unencrypted  volume and then copy the sanpshot with encryption option enabled and then create image and then find in AMIs
Based on this image launch an ec2 instance
Ec2 hibernation - the instance boots faster - beacuse it doesnt need to reload the operating system. - cant be hibernated for more than 60 days
EFS - can be mounted to multiple ec2 instances
nfsv4 protocol - only for linux for now
1000 conurrent connections , through put but expensive, content management system
standard and infrequently accessed
FSx for windows - windows file server - smb based file services
FSx for lustre - AI and machine learning
AMI - region , operating system , architecture, launch permissions   and storage for the root device(root device volume)
Instance store volume are ephemeral, They  cannot be stopped but terminated 
Delete on termination - ebs volume
AWS backup with organisations
