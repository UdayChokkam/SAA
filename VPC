Every region will have a default vpc
web(public) application(private) database(private)
cidr.xyz - for calculating ips
public subnets will be connected to internet gateway unlike private gateways - virtual private gateway
default vpc - public
1 subnet is always is 1 a vailability zone
cidr ranges can be between 10.0.0.0/16 and 10.0.0.0/28
vpc, route table , subnets, network acl , security groups
AWS uses some ips inevery subnet (5 ) first 4 and last 1 
Modify auto assign public ipv4 addresss for public subnet
Create a internet gateway and attach to a vpc
Everytime we create a subnet , it automatically gets connected to main route table so ensure main route table is not connected to internet
0.0.0.0 to internet gateway
Instance in private subnet cannot access internet , so how can we download and install software there , even for securitu patches?
NAT (network address translation) allows egress from private subnets 
we provide NAT gateway in public subnet
If your destination  is to go to internet(0.0.0.0) then your target should be nat gateway
security groups are stateful - if you send request , response traffic flows in irrespective of the restrictions
you can block ip addrress by using network acls not by security groups
network acl  can be attached to multiple subnets , but 1 subnet can be attached to only one network acl
evaluated from lowest to highest
ephermal ports?
first come first serve 
vpc  endpoints to communicate with other srevices in amazon. Traffic doesnt leav eamazon network
interface endponts , gateway endpoints (s3 , dynamo db)
vpc peering can be done across regions and accounts
vpc c, d, e, b are connected to a but to talk b and c it cant go through A rather direct peering is needed
overlapping cidr ranges not allowed for peering vpcs
private link if we want vpc for 10 and 1000 of customer vpcs
network loadbalncer on the service vpc and eni on the customer vpc for private link 
vpn cloudhub - multiple sites vpn connections
Direct connect  - dedicated network connection from on premise
vpn via internet but slow but secure and encrypted
Transit gateway  -
