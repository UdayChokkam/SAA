on-demand - kind of pay as go
reserved - reserved capacity for 3 years etc  - kind of contract, pay ypfront to reduce the cost ( standard RIs- 72 % on demand, convertible RIs, scheduled Ris - option to convert other RIs)
Reserved instances operate a regional level
spot  - unused capacity with discount prices
and dedicated - it only for you  - underlying hardware may not be shared -  may be used for regulatory projects - can use your licensing
AWS pricing calculator
1. AMI, purchasing option or spot instances , vpc, subnet , storage , tags, security group, security key pair
yum updayte -y
stopped vs terminated
aws configure to configure credentials
Roles can be assumed by users, aws architectre or other system level accounts?
Role - who can assume it and what can be done assuming role 
when role is assumed it is given temporary credentials and we can get the timeout for it 
we can attach or detatch roles to ec2 instances without stopping or terminating ec2 instances?
security groups are virtual firewalls - to let everyting in 0.0.0.0:0
yum install httpd, start it , index file in /var/www/index.html
ec2 metadata - curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
just as a handy project you can make ec2 metadata available to web by fetching ec2 instance metadata and exposing va webserver
ENI - elastic network interface for basic day to day networking
enhancednetworking - uses single root i/o virtualisation (sr-iov) to provide hgh performance
EFA - elastic fabric adapter - accelerates high performace computing and machine learning applications
eni - 1 or more security groups,private and public ipv4 and may ipv6, mac address 
enahnced networking - 10gbs -100 gbps (sr-IOV) - elastic network adapater(100gbs) or intel 82599 virtual function inetface(10gbps)
elastic fabric adapter - higher throughput  , it uses  os-bypass
placement groups - cluster, spread and partition 
cluster - grouping of ec2 instances with  in same availability zone
spread - placed on distinct unddelrying hardware
partition - distinct racks, they will power and network sources
Licensing issues with dedicated hosts - physical server
spot instances  - statelesss, fault-tolerant and flexible applcatons
maximum spot price so that is provisioned if its below the maximum spot price
price keeps varying , will have 2 mins to decide if it. ges up
spot block - 1 to 6 hrs (cant stop me )
pricing history graph for spot instances
spot instances cannot be used  for crtical workloads , databases etc
spot request
spot fleets with try to match target capacity and price restraints
strategy - capacity optimised, diversified, lowest price and instancepoolstouseocunt
userdata doest run when rebooted - its only when bootstrapping
